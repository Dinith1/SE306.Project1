# SE306.Project1

## Build Maven project

1. Run `mvn package`. This should generate a target folder on top directory
2. Open up a terminal and cd to the target folder
3. Run `java -jar project1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
4. It should run fine, if not, run `mvn clean` and try again. If it still doesn't work then Google it or let Allen know
and he will update this readme.

## For IntelliJ or eclipse users

Make sure to enable auto imports, as a maven project might mess with importing otherwise.
