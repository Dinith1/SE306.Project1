## Build Maven project

1. Run `mvn package`. This should generate a `**target**` folder on top directory
2. Open up a terminal and `cd` to the target folder
3. Run `scheduler.jar`
4. It should run fine, if not, run `mvn clean` and try again.
5. The output file should be in the same directory as your jar. i.e top level directory in `**target**` folder

## For IntelliJ or eclipse users

Make sure to enable auto imports, as a maven project might mess with importing otherwise.
